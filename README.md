# Baseball-Swing-Speed-Predictive-Model

**Author:** Gerardo Sandoval  
**Language:** Python / Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Overview

This project predicts **swing speed** for athletes at the Replay Baseball Institute using **machine learning models**. The dataset was stored in a **SQL database**, which was connected to Python for data retrieval. The project explores which features have the greatest influence on swing speed by comparing **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** models.  

Key steps include **data cleaning, filtering, feature selection, and model evaluation** to identify impactful predictors of swing performance.

## Features

- **SQL Database Integration:** Connects to a database to pull athlete and swing data.  
- **Data Cleaning & Filtering:** Prepares the dataset for accurate analysis and modeling.  
- **Predictive Modeling:** Uses **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** to predict swing speed.  
- **Feature Analysis:** Determines which factors are most predictive of faster swing speed.  
- **Visualization:** Includes plots and charts to understand feature importance and model performance.
